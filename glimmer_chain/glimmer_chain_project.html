                <h3>What is Glimmer Chain?</h3>

                <p class="desc-text">
                    Glimmer Chain is a skill-based 2D platformer where you are a robot powered by a hook and chain.
                    Jump and use the chain to complete levels.

                    The project started in June 2022 and was released in April 9 of 2024.
                    It's developed using a custom engine witch I made from scratch in C++ and the team was made by 3 people: An artists, a music and me.

                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p class="desc-text">
                    I had the following roles on development:<br>
                </p>

                <ul class="desc-text">
                    <li>Programmer of the gameplay.</li>
                    <li>Programmer of the whole game engine</li>
                    <li>Programmer of the level editor and dev tools.</li>
                    <li>Lead of the team: Managing the work of the artist and the music.</li>
                    <li>Designer.</li>
                    <li>Created all the sound effects.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="desc-text">
                    I'm also the owner and made all the marketing campaign, but it's not part of the development.

                <h3>Why Creating An Engine?</h3>
                <p class="desc-text">
                    People make me a common question: Why you don't use an existing game engine?<br>
                    Part is because I really enjoy it and wanted to have a finished and polished product made from scratch in my Portfolio. I wanted to face all the 
                    problems and learn from it to be prepared for bigger projects in the future.<br><br>
                    There are also practical reasons:
                    <ul class="desc-text">
                        <li>You have full control of what the user computer is running and how memory is managed.</li>
                        <li>Tools and the engine adapts to the project, not the way around.</li>
                        <li>For such a simple game you don't need most of the features other game engines have.</li>
                        <li>Most of the core features are reusable for other projects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
