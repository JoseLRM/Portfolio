                <p class="desc-text">
                    Glimmer Chain is a skill-based 2D platformer where you control a robot powered by a hook and chain.
                    Jump and use the chain to complete levels.

                    The project started in June 2022 and was released on April 9, 2024.
                    It was developed using a custom engine that I built from scratch in C++, and the team consisted of three people: an artist, a composer and myself.

                <h3>My Contribution</h3>
                <p class="desc-text">
                    I had the following roles in the development:<br>
                </p>

                <ul class="desc-text">
                    <li>Gameplay programmer.</li>
                    <li>Programmer of the entire game engine</li>
                    <li>Programmer of the level editor and development tools.</li>
                    <li>Team lead: Managing the work of the artist and the composer.</li>
                    <li>Game designer.</li>
                    <li>Created all the sound effects.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="desc-text">
                    I'm also the owner and handled all the marketing, although that wasn't part of the development process.

                <h3>Why Create A Custom Engine?</h3>
                <p class="desc-text">
                    People often ask me: Why didn't you use an existing game engine?<br>
                    Part of it is because I really enjoy it and wanted to have a finished and polished product made from scratch in my Portfolio. I wanted to face all the 
                    challenges head-on and learn from them to be better prepared for larger projects in the future.<br><br>
                    There are also practical reasons:
                    <ul class="desc-text">
                        <li>Full control over what the user's computer is running and how memory is managed.</li>
                        <li>The tools and engine adapt to the project, rather than the other way around.</li>
                        <li>For a simple game, you don't need many of the features other engines provide.</li>
                        <li>Most of the core features are reusable for other projects.</li>
                        <li>No licensing issues.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
